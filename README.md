Python script (IAM-check.py) for neatly listing all roles, groups and accounts in CLs for GCP IAM (iam_policy.yaml) config files\
and to automatically consolidate repeated exemption blocks in auto-generated IAP (iam_allowed_policy.textproto) files.

No prereqs, should be easy to modify if you need this to run with `p4` (Perforce).
